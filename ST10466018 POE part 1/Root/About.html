        <h2>History of the Gamecave</h2>
        <p> The Gamecave was founded in 2018 when it was a small game shop in cape town which quickly gained the support of the community
            which caused it to grow into the amazing space for gamers that it is known for now
        </p>
        <h3> Our mission and Goal</h3>
